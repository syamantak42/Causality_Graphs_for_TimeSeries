This Repository contains the following files - 
1. sparse_models_V2.py - generates and saves causality graphs for a group of time series using  different models, including several that enforces sparsity constraints
2. sparse_prediction_timeseries.py - trains and tests a one-step predictor using sparse (causal) models
3. sparse_reg_models - models used to learn (sparse) causality graphs
Notebooks are for gathering data, generating synthetic data and analyzing results
